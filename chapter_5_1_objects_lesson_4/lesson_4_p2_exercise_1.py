#Imagine you're writing an exercise-tracking app like Fitbit
#or MyFitnessPal. Part of your app is that a user can log an
#exercise session by naming the exercise, the intensity, and
#the duration.
#
#Write a class called ExerciseSession. ExerciseSession
#should have a constructor that requires two strings and an
#integer: the strings represent the exercise name and the
#exercise intensity, which will be "Low", "Moderate", or
#"High". The integer will represent the length of the
#exercise session in minutes. These should be saved in the
#instance of the class.
#
#Then, add three getters to the class. The getters should
#be named get_exercise, get_intensity, and get_duration,
#and should return the exercise string, the exercise
#intensity, and the duration, respectively.
#
#The setters should be named set_exercise, set_intensity,
#and set_duration. Each should have one parameter (besides
#self), which should be stored as the new value of
#exercise, intensity, or duration. You may assume only
#valid values will be passed in.
#
#HINT: You don't have to do any logging like you saw in
#the video! That was just an example of one benefit of
#using getters and setters, but this problem does not ask
#you to do that.


#Add your code here!
class ExerciseSession:

    def __init__(self,
                 exercise: str,
                 intensity: str,
                 duration: int):
        self.exercise = exercise
        self.intensity = intensity
        self.duration = duration

    def get_exercise(self) -> str:
        return self.exercise

    def get_intensity(self) -> str:
        return self.intensity

    def get_duration(self) -> int:
        return self.duration

    def set_exercise(self, new_exercise: str) -> None:
        self.exercise = new_exercise

    def set_intensity(self, new_intensity: str) -> None:
        self.intensity = new_intensity

    def set_duration(self, new_duration: int) -> None:
        self.duration = new_duration

#If your code is implemented correctly, the lines below
#will run error-free. They will result in the following
#output to the console:
#Running
#Low
#60
#Swimming
#High
#30
new_exercise = ExerciseSession("Running", "Low", 60)
print(new_exercise.get_exercise())
print(new_exercise.get_intensity())
print(new_exercise.get_duration())
new_exercise.set_exercise("Swimming")
new_exercise.set_intensity("High")
new_exercise.set_duration(30)
print(new_exercise.get_exercise())
print(new_exercise.get_intensity())
print(new_exercise.get_duration())
