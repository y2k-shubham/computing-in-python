# 5.1.2

#Write a class named "Phone". The Phone class should
#have an attribute called "storage" which defaults to
#128, and an attribute called "color" which defaults
#to "red".
#
#Hint: 'attribute' is another common word for
#'instance variable'.


#Write your class here!
class Phone:

    def __init__(self):
        self.storage = 128
        self.color = 'red'


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print 128 and red, each on a separate line.
new_phone = Phone()
print(new_phone.storage)
print(new_phone.color)
